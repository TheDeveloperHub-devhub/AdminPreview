# Overview #

Admin area is quite an important workplace in Magento e-commerce. In Magento, each E-Store can have hundreds of Products, Categories, and CMS Pages. Let's imagine a store where the admin must do editing for the products, categories, and CMS pages, and whenever the admin
edits any of them, it takes a lot of time for searching and verifying them on the frontend that is annoying. PHP Studios brings an ultimate solution for your multi-stores where you as an admin are just one click away to preview any product, category, or CMS page after editing. Preview links are available on every edit product page, edit category page, and edit CMS page. Also, the preview link is included in the product grid table action to redirect admin to the frontend after a
click.

### Features ###

* Admin can easily enable or disable Admin Preview for products, categories, or CMS pages. 

After enabling the configuration for admin product preview:
